    "Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero. It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation. The Input is an array of strings where each element is either a valid operator or an integer. E.g.[“1”,”2”,”+”]"
