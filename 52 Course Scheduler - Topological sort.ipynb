    "You have to take a total of n courses leabled from 0 to n-1. Before you can take some courses you need to take itâ€™s prerequisite courses. You are given an array prerequisites where each element [x,y] indicates that to take course x you have to take y first. E.g. [2,3] indicates that to take course 2 one has to first take course 3. Write a function that takes in n and the prerequisite array and returns true if you can complete all courses, else return false."
