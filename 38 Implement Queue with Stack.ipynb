    "## Implement Queue with Stack\n",
    "Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).<br>\n",
    "Implement the MyQueue class:<br>\n",
    "1. push(val) Pushes element val to the back of the queue.<br>\n",
    "2. pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.<br>\n",
    "3. peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.<br>\n",
    "4. empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.<br>\n",
    "Notes: You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid. Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations. Follow-up: Implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity. In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer."
